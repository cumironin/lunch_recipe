      <description>Every time my family and I go to a Chinese buffet we make a bee line for the green beans! This is a simple and tasty re-creation of that much loved side dish, goes well with any Asian meal. Make sure to slice the garlic, don&amp;rsquo;t use a garlic press. Oyster sauce can be found in the Asian section of your grocery store, at an Asian grocery store, and online.</description>

Basically, there&amp;rsquo;s my mom&amp;rsquo;s recipe, which is perfect, and every other version.

      <description>I found this recipe a while ago on a Swedish blog, and I have made it many times since then. I made some moderations to make it even better, and now it&amp;rsquo;s the whole family&amp;rsquo;s favorite snack. It tastes just like Snickers® but instead of artificial flavorings and white sugar you get healthy ingredients like almonds, dates, and dark chocolate. Try it&amp;ndash;you won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed!

      <description>Traditional Indian dish made of spiced cauliflower and potatoes. This dish is steamed and then fried in oil making it intentionally dry and somewhat crispy. WARNING: This dish is extremely spicy, which is the way I like it. However, if you don&amp;rsquo;t like your food that spicy, feel free to cut down on the serrano pepper and/or cayenne pepper. Also, I would recommend serving this with a side of raita or plain yogurt to cool the mouth down after eating.</description>

      <description>Normally Chai has tea in it, but this beverage doesn&amp;rsquo;t miss it at all. When I lived in Holland, this drink was a staple in the diet of a bunch of hippies who lived in and around a squatted building known as &amp;lsquo;De Elf.&amp;rsquo; Sadly, the building was closed a year after I left the country, but if you combine the taste of this drink with the smell of musky smoke and Nag Champa incense, you&amp;rsquo;re halfway to recreating the atmosphere.</description>

      <description>There is nothing better than homemade applesauce with hand-picked apples, and it is so easy to do! If you want chunky applesauce, use a potato masher to mash the cooked apples. If you prefer smooth apple sauce, run the cooked apples through a food mill. The key is adding a few strips of lemon peel to the apples while cooking. The lemon heightens the apple flavor. Make sure you use a good cooking apple like Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji, Jonathan, Mcintosh, or Gravenstein.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is about this combination of flavors, but I could eat these every day. Even though it contains the right ingredients in the right proportions for a teriyaki sauce, which is what I was aiming for originally, to describe the flavor as such would be inaccurate. I&amp;rsquo;m usually perfectly happy with this and a bowl of rice as a meal in itself, but when I&amp;rsquo;m forced to share, it pairs well with roasted chicken or just about any kind of pork.</description>

      <description>This is a delicious way to take advantage of early spring&amp;rsquo;s flavorful asparagus. A great dish to accompany large, busy meals, as most of the work can be done ahead of time and the asparagus reheated with the tomatoes and garlic at the last minute while the roast (or whatever else) is resting. Also a delicious preparation for green beans in place of the asparagus.

      <description>Fattoush is a Lebanese salad, good for hot weather. This recipe uses two unusual ingredients: sumac and purslane.

      <description>This is a substantial soup with an amazing flavor. Finely minced carrot and fresh herbs are a nice addition to this soup; I add the carrots in with the onions in the extra-virgin olive oil at the start, and the fresh chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro, fresh mint, or whatever the creatures in the garden haven&amp;rsquo;t devoured) just before serving as a garnish. My family prefers this with common brown lentils, but Umbrian or red lentils would work well here too.</description>

      <description>This avocado sushi recipe goes over the basics of sushi rolling so that you can make your own amazing brown rice sushi. It might take some practice to get the hang of rolling, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. Short grain brown rice is sticky enough to use instead of white sushi rice, but long grain brown rice will not work. Use apple cider vinegar if you can&amp;rsquo;t find brown rice vinegar. Bowls of tamari (or soy sauce), pickled ginger and wasabi are commonly served alongside for dipping.</description>

The seeds had so much value they were used as a form of currency. Originally prepared only as a drink, chocolate was served bitter and spicy. Often this gift from the gods was reserved for royalty and religious leadership. It was believed to give strength and so was added to a soldier&amp;rsquo;s rations.</description>

      <description>A basic barbecued potato dish takes on a delicious twist thanks to garlic scapes, the flower stalks of the garlic plant. My family absolutely flipped over these potatoes so I take advantage whenever scapes are available. The garlic scapes add a wonderful garlic flavor to the potatoes without being overpowering and they almost have the consistency of young asparagus stalks. The texture of the potatoes and the scapes is interesting and makes a satisfying side dish to any early summer barbecue.</description>

I think these go especially well with pork or chicken. This recipe can easily be doubled, tripled, or expanded to whatever amount you need without adding very much to the preparation time.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/lunch/bobs-habanero-hot-sauce-liquid-fire/</guid>
      <description>Using fewer habanero peppers can reduce the spiciness in this extremely hot habanero hot sauce. The sauce works wonders as a pick-up for Bloody Mary drinks. Flavors meld wonderfully and the sauce keeps nicely for a long time. Warning: A dash is all you need and it is best to use gloves when handling the habanera peppers.
INGRIDIENT  12 habanero peppers, seeded and chopped   1 (15.5 ounce) can sliced peaches in heavy syrup   ½ cup dark molasses   ½ cup yellow mustard   ½ cup light brown sugar   1 cup distilled white vinegar   2 tablespoons salt   2 tablespoons paprika   1 tablespoon black pepper   1 tablespoon ground cumin   ½ teaspoon ground coriander   ½ teaspoon ground ginger   ½ teaspoon ground allspice</description>

      <description>This delicious bolognese is extremely quick and easy to make. Serve over pasta, rice, couscous, or any other carbohydrate food you fancy.

Everyone I know who I cook this for has fallen absolutely in love with it. You can eat it while it&amp;rsquo;s still warm, that&amp;rsquo;s how I like it best. Refrigerating it makes it more of a pasta salad.

      <description>A favorite named after Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana and for the bourbon whiskey ingredient; although this dish, sold as Cajun-style cuisine in malls all over America, is reported to be nothing of the kind (not genuine Creole or Cajun fare)!

Be careful when opening foil as steam will have formed inside and can burn you.</description>

      <description>An easy way to use that tuna you have sitting around and that weird quinoa stuff you got at the health food store. This is great if you want a tuna salad sandwich but don&amp;rsquo;t or can&amp;rsquo;t have bread, or also if you like sushi because it has a nice wasabi kick and a texture reminiscent of sticky rice. And, it has a good crunch and flavor with chopped celery and onion.</description>

      <description>This is an extremely healthy drink I have almost every morning and great on detoxes as you get all your needed nutrients. You just have to play around to find the perfect drink. I find if you add beetroot, it makes it a fantastic color and gives extra flavor. To get the full benefit of the flavor, swish the juice around in your mouth; this is where lots of nutrients are digested.</description>

      <description>I remember my aunt telling me about quinoa, saying it was such a wonderfully healthy food and what do you know? It&amp;rsquo;s kosher for Passover! I decided to beef up my quinoa with some fresh vegetables, cooked until they are just tender without becoming mushy. As a side dish this serves 4-5, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been known to eat half of it as a meal on its own.
INGRIDIENT  2 teaspoons olive oil   ½ onion, chopped   1 cup quinoa   2 cups water   2 tablespoons vegetarian chicken-flavored bouillon granules   1 teaspoon ground black pepper   1 teaspoon thyme   1 carrot, chopped   1 tomato, chopped   1 cup baby spinach</description>

      <description>I took some leftover quinoa pilaf and added black beans and ground turkey. It made an excellent one-dish meal that hits the table in a hurry. I found it was a good way to use up the leftovers from another dinner. We have the pilaf as a side dish for the two of us, and it is always too much. Adding ground turkey and black beans makes another unique meal that is quick to prepare.</description>

      <description>Convenient (and relatively inexpensive) way to have chai &amp;lsquo;lattes&amp;rsquo; at home. The cardamom can be a bit expensive; try looking in the bulk section of a health food store. If you need to buy a jar of it, don&amp;rsquo;t worry - it will make several batches!

      <description>Indian food is not just curried sauces. It&amp;rsquo;s not too exotic either. Unless &amp;lsquo;exotic&amp;rsquo; is code for &amp;lsquo;yummy and full of flavor.&amp;rsquo; This dish features a healthy mixture of chickpeas, tomatoes, onion, and spices. Both carnivores and vegetarians will enjoy this meal. My kids love it. Leave out the green chile if the kiddies will be eating. Serve over basmati or jasmine rice and enjoy. Namaste y&amp;rsquo;all!

      <description>An addictive alternative made with nutritional yeast. Who would have thought that leafy green chips loaded with nutrients could be so addictive? Nutritional yeast is deactivated yeast; it&amp;rsquo;s not alive and has a slightly cheesy flavor which many vegans like to use as a cheese substitute. It can be found at most health food stores and some big-chain grocery stores.

      <description>I was looking around for a name for this unusual clafoutis-like combination of peaches, blackberries, thyme, and black pepper. I saw an article that said in France a clafoutis that uses fruit other than cherries is called a flognarde. I enjoy saying flognarde so much that I think even if this recipe hadn&amp;rsquo;t come out as well as it did I would still make it regularly, just to say &amp;lsquo;flognarde&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/lunch/chef-johns-salmon-in-parchment/</guid>
      <description>Cooking fish in parchment paper is incredibly simple, and yet fairly terrifying for a novice cook. Since the seafood is encased in paper, there&amp;rsquo;s really no good way to check if it&amp;rsquo;s done. The good news: if you use a large, center-cut salmon filet, about 8 or 9 ounces, and cook it for 15 minutes at 400 degrees F, you&amp;rsquo;re going to be very, very close.
INGRIDIENT  1 teaspoon olive oil, or more if needed   6 small potatoes   10 spears asparagus   2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless, center-cut salmon fillets   salt and ground black pepper to taste   1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the best thing about being a chef? It&amp;rsquo;s being able to name your dishes anything you want! The exotic, tropical tang of the fruit and the richness of the wild salmon work wonderfully together. The &amp;lsquo;bango&amp;rsquo; comes from the spicy sweet pepper jam I use to bind the fresh mango relish.
INGRIDIENT  1 mango - peeled, seeded and diced   2 tablespoons lime juice   2 tablespoons red bell pepper and ancho chili pepper jam   2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro   2 salmon fillets, skin removed   sea salt to taste   2 teaspoons vegetable oil</description>

      <description>This may be America&amp;rsquo;s oldest vegetable recipe, coming from a Narragansett Indian word, &amp;lsquo;msickquatash,&amp;rsquo; which, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, means &amp;lsquo;boiled corn kernels.&amp;rsquo; When most of you hear the word succotash, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t think of a delicious vegetable side dish, you probably think of the catchphrase, &amp;lsquo;Sufferin&amp;rsquo; succotash!&#39; But succotash really is a great and very underrated recipe.
INGRIDIENT  1 tablespoon olive oil   1 ½ teaspoons butter   ½ yellow onion, diced   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste   ½ red bell pepper, diced   1 jalapeno pepper, sliced   3 cloves garlic, minced   ½ cup diced tomatoes   ½ teaspoon ground cumin   1 pinch cayenne pepper   2 green zucchinis, cut into cubes   4 ounces fresh green beans, cut into 1/2-inch pieces   ¼ cup water   1 ½ cups corn   1 cup frozen baby lima beans, thawed</description>

      <description>I decided to give the old no-knead ciabatta a higher-fiber makeover. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have much whole wheat baking experience, I did what any good chef would do: I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any research and just tried to figure it out. I was quite happy with the taste and texture, and going 50/50 with the all-purpose flour provided just enough of that crusty, chewy ‘normal&#39; bread experience.
INGRIDIENT  1 cup warm water   ½ cup all-purpose flour   ½ cup whole wheat flour   ¼ cup rye flour   ¼ teaspoon active dry yeast   1 cup all-purpose flour   1 cup whole wheat flour   ½ cup water at room temperature   2 tablespoons shelled sunflower seeds   1 tablespoon polenta   1 tablespoon ground flax seeds   1 ¾ teaspoons salt   1 ½ teaspoons honey   1 teaspoon all-purpose flour, or as needed   ½ teaspoon cornmeal, or as needed   water as needed</description>

The sweet crabmeat in a piquant tomato broth makes an elegant dinner party starter, or can be served with a few simple quesadillas for an easy dinner at home.

I&amp;rsquo;ve tried several different brands of colas, but have found that Coke® works best. I like to pre-cook the bacon about half-way so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the beans too greasy, but it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary. This recipe can also be baked in a conventional oven at 350 degrees F for about 1 hour.</description>

It will still taste okay, but it won&amp;rsquo;t look very pretty.

      <description>This piquant chutney is not as sweet as traditional cranberry sauce. The bite of the fresh ginger will become more pronounced as the chutney rests. If you have any left after Thanksgiving, try it in turkey sandwiches with a smear of cream cheese. Oh. My. God.

It&amp;rsquo;s not only the best vegan corn chowder recipe I&amp;rsquo;ve had, but it&amp;rsquo;s just plain the best corn chowder ever.</description>

I serve them in a 16 oz. double-walled cup. For a smoother taste, first grind up the rolled oats.</description>

      <description>I first had this served over egg noodles, but served with rice is just as nice. This recipe was introduced to me by a Cuban friend when I was seven years old. To this day, (twenty years later), it remains one of my favourites. Don&amp;rsquo;t be frightened by this seemingly strange combination of ingredients; this is brilliant! The nice thing about this recipe is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any measurements. You use an equal amount of each ingredient, so it&amp;rsquo;s infinitely scalable!</description>

      <description>This is what Elvis would drink if he were alive and on a health kick! It&amp;rsquo;s based off his love for the peanut butter and banana, but this has some substitutions and additions. Freeze the bananas the night before so that they take the place of the ice. If you add enough almond butter, this can taste exactly like banana bread. Or if you add chocolate or espresso, it tastes like bananas dipped in chocolate fondue.</description>

The combination of the mustard and molasses give it a great sweet-tart flavor, and the bourbon adds a finishing touch you can&amp;rsquo;t get any other way!</description>

The nice thing about this is you make what you need at the time and don&amp;rsquo;t have to bother with leftovers.

      <description>A rich, flavorful sauce that is healthy. Great for use in pasta, lasagna, and other casseroles. My favorite way to eat it is to pour over raw zucchini &amp;lsquo;pasta&amp;rsquo; for an extra-fresh and tasty meal that&amp;rsquo;s very healthy, too! A great recipe for using up extra-ripe tomatoes from your garden. Double the batch and freeze half; it freezes well.
INGRIDIENT  3 tablespoons olive oil   ½ onion, chopped   8 large tomatoes, peeled and cut into big chunks   6 cloves garlic, minced   1 bay leaf   ½ cup red wine   1 tablespoon honey   2 teaspoons dried basil   1 teaspoon oregano   1 teaspoon dried marjoram   1 teaspoon salt   ½ teaspoon ground black pepper   ¼ teaspoon fennel seed   ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper   2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, or more to taste</description>

      <description>Caught in a pinch for a salad when unexpected company showed up at mealtime, I improvised with this combination. Instantly it became one of my family&amp;rsquo;s favorites. Best of all, it is quick and easy. You can use lemon yogurt instead of strawberry, if you wish.
INGRIDIENT  1 pint fresh strawberries, sliced   1 pound seedless green grapes, halved   3 bananas, peeled and sliced   1 (8 ounce) container strawberry yogurt</description>

      <description>This is a sweet fruit salad intended to be served as a low-fat dessert. The syrup is essential; without it, you just have an ordinary fruit salad, for which you probably don&amp;rsquo;t need a recipe! You can vary the fruits to use what you have on hand. This is especially good with strawberries and melon. Bananas might be too overpowering, though.
INGRIDIENT  1 cup white sugar   ½ cup water   3 1-inch strips of lemon zest   1 cinnamon stick   2 tablespoons lemon juice   4 mango, pitted, peeled, and cut into chunks   4 white peaches, pitted and cut into bite-sized pieces   2 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and sliced   4 (6 ounce) containers fresh raspberries   ¼ cup finely chopped fresh mint   2 tablespoons lemon juice</description>

      <description>This is my doctored up version of a diet ambrosia salad my mom always made. I admit that this sounds strange, but it really is sweet and refreshing on a hot summer day! (It&amp;rsquo;s not as low-cal as hers.) It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to adjust to your family&amp;rsquo;s fruit preferences. Be sure to drain the fruit very well so the salad is not too soupy.
INGRIDIENT  1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained   1 cup white sugar   1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese   2 (15.</description>

      <description>This is a recipe that my aunt made for me not long ago, and you can pretty much make it your own by adding your favorite fruits or taking out what you don&amp;rsquo;t like. Also changing the yogurt flavor will change the taste as well.

      <description>The fun of this recipe is that it can be tailored to your tastes. I&amp;rsquo;m a &amp;lsquo;throw it in and see how it turns out&amp;rsquo; kind of cook, so please adjust the recipe to fit your own tastes. This recipe is best used immediately, as fresh fruit doesn&amp;rsquo;t keep well in the refrigerator. If you prefer baked cinnamon chips, arrange the tortilla triangles in a single layer on a lightly greased baking sheet.</description>

They do not brown like regular pancakes, either.

      <description>Vegetable stock for all your needs without the MSG and chemicals in industrial versions. This helps use up whatever veggies and fruit you might have around. Nothing goes to waste. Add any veggies you might have left over. I use the end pieces of green beans and whatever &amp;lsquo;unwanted&amp;rsquo; outer parts of vegetables I get from cooking and keep them in a bag in the fridge until the next time I make stock.</description>

      <description>Goat is a delicious, mild-flavored meat that is overlooked in the U.S. This recipe results in a tender, savory dish that, while unusual, is still basically good old comfort food.

      <description>This hot cereal is a delicious twist on oatmeal with some added protein and fiber to help satisfy you and keep you full. It&amp;rsquo;s a great start for a good morning!

      <description>This is a Polish way of making chicken stock. It is very rich because of the stewing hen. A stewing hen is an older chicken, therefore it is much richer tasting than fryers, roasters, etc. It is a clear, rich broth that I fed to my children. They still ask for it when they are feeling sick. It is truly the Polish cure for anything when you&amp;rsquo;re feeling down and out.</description>

Everyone in the family has been trying to recreate this delicious coffee cake for years. It is moist and very flavorful. I added the strawberries because I like it a little sweeter. Rhubarb is an ingredient that you don&amp;rsquo;t see used very often any more, but those of us who do use it always love to find new ways to spread the love.</description>

      <description>This recipe is especially good for those who are afraid to put fish on the grill, thinking that it will stick to it or not be sturdy enough to be cooked this way. That is not the case of tuna. The fact that you cook it as a roast, without slicing it into steaks, ensures the tenderness and moisture inside the meat. Its simply delicious!

      <guid>http://example.org/lunch/grilled-vegetables-in-balsamic-tomato-sauce-with-couscous/</guid>
      <description>The sweetness of grilled vegetables is balanced by a tart tomato sauce, which mixes perfectly with simple couscous. Preferably use a heavy grill pan. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have one you can use a baking tray beneath an oven grill, or even roast the vegetables in a hot oven and then transfer them to a pan for the last part. But you will get more of the char-grill flavor if you use a pan.</description>

      <description>I first tasted this tea in a popular Italian restaurant in my college hometown of Kailua. I have been craving it ever since, and have experimented with a few proportions.

      <description>Use whichever spice combinations you prefer. The key to baking white meat without it getting dry is topping it with butter and wrapping it in parchment paper. It locks in the moisture and is tender and juicy every single time. The paper absorbs most all of the butter so you are not actually consuming it.
INGRIDIENT  1 teaspoon garlic powder   1 teaspoon smoked paprika   ½ teaspoon ground mustard   ½ teaspoon parsley flakes   ½ teaspoon salt   ½ teaspoon ground black pepper   1 tablespoon olive oil   2 (12 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts   2 tablespoons butter   parchment paper</description>

      <description>Ever wonder what to do when you have too much jicama?
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick guide to making a quick snack. Best served with barbeque sauce. The stripes on the fries are caused by the moisture escaping the jicama and creating fissures where the starch from the jicama collects and browns.

DIRECTION  Step: 1
Spray a microwave-safe plate with cooking spray.</description>

      <description>Flavorful take on an old bbq standby. Other seasonings can be added as well, depending on preference. I find that chili powder adds a nice kick. Serve right after tossing if you prefer a nice crunchy slaw or let marinade in the fridge for an hour before dishing up. Great with grilled veggies, Mexican style corn on the cob, and smoked chicken breast.

      <description>This quick and easy salsa can be made in just a few minutes with a food processor. Green onions instead of white onions give it a nice, mellow flavor to balance the kick of the jalapenos. This recipe also works well with 2-3 habanero peppers instead of the jalapenos. But be sure to remove the seeds and membrane from the habaneros first! Grab a bag of tortilla chips, dip, eat, and enjoy!</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been making this soup for myself my whole college career, since it&amp;rsquo;s a soup my mom made when I was growing up. This soup is illegally easy and incredibly good for you. Eat it up! You can add sliced, shredded, or diced cooked chicken to the soup when it is almost ready. This soup is delicious, but it can be a surprisingly dull color.</description>

Make sure to allow enough time to make ahead and let all the flavors marry in the fridge before serving.

      <description>After lots of experimenting to develop a low-fat ice cream or gelato, I came up with this recipe. Despite the lengthy instructions, it&amp;rsquo;s very simple to make. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe how wonderfully rich and creamy it turned out to be. The secret is in the cocoa powder, which makes the gelato dense and rich without adding fat. Because the gelato contains no fat, leftovers will freeze hard. To soften, defrost leftovers in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds.</description>

      <description>This is my fancy version of a peanut butter and jelly smoothie. It&amp;rsquo;s bursting with vitamins, minerals, and protein. You can use peanut butter in this recipe, but it kind of clashes with the berry flavor. Cashew butter is milder and seems to compliment well. I make my own cashew-walnut-macadamia nut butter, and it&amp;rsquo;s stellar in this smoothie! This recipe is very versatile; this is just my favorite way to prepare it, although I don&amp;rsquo;t always add the banana.</description>

Mangos are juicy deliciousness. So flavorful I&amp;rsquo;m always reluctant to put them in a smoothie. They are too fragile to share the spotlight with other ingredients. But if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to find too many ripe ones in the fridge, this is where they belong.

      <description>I have used this for years. If you are a connoisseur of mincemeat, you will be able to tell this is a good recipe while you are cooking it, and you add the spices to the fruit, and it magically changes to that wonderful aroma of&amp;hellip;.mincemeat! If you want to, you can omit the meat in this recipe. I prefer peach or apricot brandy for this recipe. If desired you can use half beef and half pork rather than all pork.</description>

      <description>I grew up with this in the UK, and this is how everyone made it. I would be surprised if any pub had additional ingredients. Mint has a sweetness of its own, but a little sugar would be okay, if the diner had a desire for extra sweetness - no more that 1/2 teaspoon. Cider or malt vinegar can be used for the vinegar if you prefer. This sauce is traditionally served with lamb.</description>

Also, fresh oregano or lemon thyme could be substituted for thyme.</description>

      <description>This is a simple recipe, yet it is the best black bean soup I&amp;rsquo;ve tried. I have been lucky to get home smoked ham, and used the bone from it. I&amp;rsquo;ve also made it with smoked ham hocks I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten from the butcher. Of course the home smoked ham makes the soup superlative, the butcher bone made it wonderful. Either way, I think you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy it. It can be made spicy if that&amp;rsquo;s the way you prefer it.</description>

      <description>Roasted vegetables are one of my absolute favorite side dishes, especially in the winter. They take a while to cook, but overall are an extremely easy dish to prepare. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the key is to place them low in the oven so that you get a good caramelized side. Don&amp;rsquo;t move or flip them, but keep an eye on them so that you don&amp;rsquo;t go past &amp;lsquo;caramelized&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;burned.&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>The flavors of the broccoli and sweet potatoes compliment each other wonderfully in this recipe! I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if steaming the sweet potatoes was necessary or not. It might be okay to skip that step. However, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if they would get tender enough by just cooking them in oil, so I went ahead and did it and it turned out great!
INGRIDIENT  1 cup quinoa   2 cups water   1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes   2 tablespoons canola oil   1 onion, chopped   2 cups frozen chopped broccoli, thawed   1 tablespoon garlic powder   ½ cup whole almonds   1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste (Optional)</description>

Season chops (or pork tenderloin) with a mixture of even parts cumin, coriander, garlic powder, and salt, plus a sprinkle of cayenne; grill, then serve with the chutney.</description>

      <description>A delicious deviation from the typical squash preparation, this recipe has kind of a nutty flavor with or without the nuts. Good as-is, but of course each person can salt and pepper their own serving to taste. The leftovers are good served as a cold salad if you don&amp;rsquo;t like the cooked spinach that results from re-heating. Almonds and walnuts can be used in addition to or instead of the pecans.</description>

      <description>Butternut squash, sweet potato, carrot, and garlic roasted in large pieces and then added to onion, celery, apple, and vegetable broth.

      <description>A sworn lover of parsnips, this is but one more way to fix them. The use of celery root, a.k.a. celeriac, was an accident since I thought I was buying a rutabaga but it was an excellent addition. I&amp;rsquo;ve served this to company with rave reviews and it&amp;rsquo;s fairly healthy if you use the oil sparingly. Great way to enjoy fall and winter produce.

      <description>Simple and light. The roasted tomato gives a light and tangy flavor which balances with the starchiness of the potatoes. Use a red or yellow potato for best flavor. Garlic, fresh basil, and a hint of rosemary add to the aroma. My girlfriend loves this as a side with chicken or pork.

      <description>My mom has been making the stew for many years and it is by far the BEST stew I have ever tasted. It is hearty, filling, and inexpensive not to mention extremely delicious and fairly easy to make. The hardest part and the most time-consuming part for this stew is preparing the vegetables. I chop and dice all my vegetables by hand and so it can consume a little bit more time, but it is very much worth the extra time it takes.</description>

      <description>I wanted to make a Mardi Gras King Cake for my friends because we are expatriates in Malaysia with no bakeries that can make them, and some people we know have never even tried one! However, I wanted to make it lighter too, so I made some substitutions and created my own cake that appears and tastes decadent, but is actually quite light. Bakeries in Louisiana do standard cinnamon-sugar fillings, but they do all kinds of other fruit/pudding fillings, too, so I decided to go fruity.</description>

      <description>This is my favorite kale salad. It is super nutrient-dense and loaded with healthy fats and lots of flavor. The technique of &amp;lsquo;massaging&amp;rsquo; the kale is very important since it breaks it down, softens the texture, and makes it more palatable. Please take the time to remove the leaves from the stems. The stems are tough and very bitter. Use any kind of kale for this recipe.
INGRIDIENT  1 bunch green kale, stemmed and leaves roughly chopped   1 bunch red kale, stemmed and leaves roughly chopped   ½ cup chopped pecans   ¼ cup apple cider vinegar   1 tablespoon honey   1 ½ teaspoons chipotle pepper powder   1 ½ teaspoons smoked paprika   1 teaspoon liquid amino acid (such as Bragg®)   1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and chopped</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t normally drink pumpkin spice lattes, but when I do, I make my own and don&amp;rsquo;t drop 5 dollars at the corner coffee stand. And this version, with a spicy kick, actually has pumpkin in it! Cooking the pumpkin and the spices in the saucepan eliminates any raw squash flavor and makes the spices toastier. And the black pepper gives this latte a nice kick.

      <description>I love this recipe because it uses fresh, sweet red bell peppers, as opposed to roasted red peppers. It&amp;rsquo;s full of other fresh vegetables and thyme, too, and it freezes exceptionally well. Rice is used as the thickening agent, rather than cream. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like a lot of spice, reduce the amount of cayenne and red pepper flakes.

Inspired by Mexican Chia Fresca and my love for mojitos! The juice can be drunk without waiting the 30 minutes, but the seeds might stick to the glass more. A juicer can be used to juice the strawberries and mint. Doing so will give more mint flavor and may require using less mint to begin with.</description>

      <description>This is great at a picnic when you have tired of all the same old salads. Very versatile, you can serve it cold or room temperature. You can certainly chop up the asparagus, but I found that it always overcooks. I like the presentation of the long spears on a nice white platter. This goes great with a platter of sliced baked ham and some potato salad or with hamburgers and hot dogs.</description>

      <description>Delicata squash is one of the best winter squashes even though it is a fairly &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; squash. The skin can be eaten and it is almost the best part of the squash. I was curious about the squash when I saw it at the farmer market and &amp;lsquo;had to have it&amp;rsquo; and this is how I chose to make it. Kids and adults love it!

When I take this dish to another person&amp;rsquo;s home, I bake the first time and add the yams, cover, and then wait to heat until I am at their house.</description>

      <description>This whole wheat bread has a really good taste depending on your flour. I think King Arthur® is the best! This bread has cocoa and coffee in it. It can be made by hand, or use your bread machine&amp;rsquo;s dough setting to knead and rise, then bake it in the oven. If you are not feeling bold you can leave out the cocoa and coffee and add some nuts. Have fun!</description>

      <description>Easy and wonderful teriyaki marinade for barbeque or roasting. For a zestier marinade, use lime or lemon juice; for a milder version, use water. If you would like to use the marinade as a sauce, you can boil it after removing the meat and add a little slurry of cornstarch and warm water to thicken it. When I make the sauce, I usually add some sesame seeds for looks. You can add fresh or ground ginger if you like, too.</description>

      <description>My family loved ordering this dish at our local Thai restaurant, but then they closed down for some unknown reason (they were always busy). So I decided to recreate this traditional dish at home. My husband says it&amp;rsquo;s just like the restaurant&amp;hellip;maybe even better? Please note that some people like to eat the ginger, while others don&amp;rsquo;t but like the flavor it gives off. You can easily double this recipe to serve a larger group&amp;hellip;plus it makes great leftovers.</description>

      <description>This is a refreshing salad using all different kinds of vegetables. You can use whatever you like, but the main things that makes it good are the tomatoes and cucumbers. It is much like an Israeli salad. The homemade dressing is very good on it, but so is just plain olive oil.

      <description>My green savory drink.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a recipe that I liked online, so I made my own. I use a Vitamix® 7500 and crank it up to 7 or 8 for 35 to 45 seconds and it&amp;rsquo;s smooth and drinkable. I blend rather than juice because I can&amp;rsquo;t rationalize throwing out fruit/vegetable pulp. Throw one of these back every day and feel the power!

      <description>Halushky is a Ukrainian name for dumplings made of batter or thick dough mixture. Various ingredients are added for tenderness, texture, flavor, and food value. They are served with a stew, or roast and gravy, or as a side dish. Good halushky should be light. Their lightness depends on the proportions used and on the method of cooking them. This standard recipe may be varied as desired. Dry curd cheese is preferred for a filling because a wet, creamy one will melt giving flat and empty varenyky or halushky.</description>

      <description>This makes a very thick vegetarian split pea soup. To make it thinner, reduce the amount of split peas or add more water. Depending on the density of split peas, it may take a while for the vegetables and peas to soften, but you can&amp;rsquo;t really overcook this soup; just stir occasionally, and add water if it gets too dry. Seasonings can be altered to taste. Tastes even better reheated.</description>

      <description>This recipe was passed down from a friend, and now it is one of our favorites! It&amp;rsquo;s great to make whenever there is left over chicken or turkey around! We pray for colder weather in California just so we can make this soup! You can substitute additional diced tomatoes for the tomatillos. If you would like the soup to be spicier, you can add some red chili flakes or salsa. Serve with these toppings for people to choose from: limes, cilantro, cheese, avocado, sour cream, and tortilla chips.</description>

      <description>Amazing, fill-your-house-with-an-aroma-to-drool-for, easy chicken soup. The longer it cooks, the better it gets. The best is made by my mother, but the rest of us can make this wonderful facsimile. Easily multiplied, exceedingly flexible - have fun! The soup is quite good after 2 hours, but the longer it cooks, the more mellow the flavor will be. If you can, leave it for as many as 6 hours (this is a good recipe when you&amp;rsquo;re in the house all day).</description>

      <description>These gluten-free, lactose-free crepes are not only made 100% with buckwheat, but they use wholesome raw buckwheat groats instead of buckwheat flour, which often has a very strong flavor when not fresh. Soaking the groats before using them develops a lovely texture and a delicious, soft nutty taste. After blending you end up with a smooth batter. These crepes do not crisp up and become golden but they are very pliable and go great with maple syrup, berries, jam, and mashed bananas as filling.</description>
