**Step: 2**

When the dough is stiff enough, turn out onto a floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 7 minutes. Knead in more flour if necessary to keep the dough from being sticky. Place dough in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat. Cover, and set in a warm place to rise until double in size.{{< span >}}

**Step: 3**

Punch down dough, and form into a tight ball by folding the sides into the center. The tighter the ball, the more it will rise instead of just spreading.
