description: "This delicious salad may be served warm or at room temperature. It takes patience to cook the vegetables properly, but it makes a wonderful side to any fall feast! Enjoy the process of creating something your family will enjoy. Substituting regular broccoli may be okay, but baby broccoli is sweeter and more suited to this dish."
