description: "This is a substantial soup with an amazing flavor. Finely minced carrot and fresh herbs are a nice addition to this soup; I add the carrots in with the onions in the extra-virgin olive oil at the start, and the fresh chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro, fresh mint, or whatever the creatures in the garden haven't devoured) just before serving as a garnish. My family prefers this with common brown lentils, but Umbrian or red lentils would work well here too. We have this soup with thin slices of baguette and a salad tossed with balsamic dressing."
