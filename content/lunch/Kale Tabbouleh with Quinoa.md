I got this recipe from a good friend. I absolutely love it. 

It is a refreshing and surprisingly healthy salad. You can have it as a side dish, or, for a heartier meal, throw some grilled chicken on it and enjoy! The salad can be eaten right away or kept in the fridge for up to three days. If you make it in advance, toss the salad again before serving to redistribute the juices.
