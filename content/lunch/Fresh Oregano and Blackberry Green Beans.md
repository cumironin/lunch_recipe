description: "This super-easy side dish utilizes the bounty of late summer and is the perfect companion to whatever you are grilling - in fact, the stove can be turned on while the meat is resting from the grill.  The sweet acidity of the berries balances the entire meal, and the fresh oregano brings out the best of both the berries and the beans.  It's a beautiful, unusual side dish that leaves guests, and even finicky family, raving."
