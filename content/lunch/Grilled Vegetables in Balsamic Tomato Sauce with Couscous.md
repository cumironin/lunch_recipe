description: "The sweetness of grilled vegetables is balanced by a tart tomato sauce, which mixes perfectly with simple couscous.  Preferably use a heavy grill pan.  If you don't have one you can use a baking tray beneath an oven grill, or even roast the vegetables in a hot oven and then transfer them to a pan for the last part. But you will get more of the char-grill flavor if you use a pan. If you want to make more or less couscous, just use the same quantity of water as couscous.  This dish keeps well, as the flavor of the vegetables seems to grow stronger.  It is just as nice served lightly warmed for lunch as hot for a dinner, or use it as a cold dish in a selection of salads."
