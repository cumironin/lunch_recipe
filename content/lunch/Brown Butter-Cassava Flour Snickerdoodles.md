These grain-free cassava flour cookies are made with coconut sugar, so they're much healthier than the traditional version, slightly less sweet, and full of cinnamon-y goodness. Because cassava flour is more starchy, expect a bit drier cookie and be sure to let them cool completely on the cookie sheet.
