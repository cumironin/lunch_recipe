description: "We love to stray from our typical bulk purchase of cartons of unsweetened almond milk and from time to time we make our own homemade naturally sweetened almond milk. We have played around with different recipes and feel this makes something truly enjoyable - smooth, creamy, and packed with flavor. You'll need a sturdy blender, a nut milk bag or cheesecloth, and a bowl large enough to hold your milk during the filtering process, and finally a container to store your milk in."
