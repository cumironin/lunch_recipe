description: "I've always liked this recipe because it is quick and easy. I'm always looking for ways to cut out excess fat so I use reduced-fat cheese and sour cream. I also like to add fiber to make the meal a little healthier for my family so I add black beans and some bell peppers. This also adds color! To make it super healthy I use whole-wheat flour tortillas. And it still tastes just as delicious!"

I've always liked this recipe because it is quick and easy. I'm always looking for ways to cut out excess fat so I use reduced-fat cheese and sour cream. I also like to add fiber to make the meal a little healthier for my family so I add black beans and some bell peppers. This also adds color! To make it super healthy I use whole-wheat flour tortillas. And it still tastes just as delicious!
