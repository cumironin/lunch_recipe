I made this up last night looking for something to do with a bag of beautiful baby eggplants I got. They were purple eggplants, but smallish. They were nice because they did not have a lot of seeds.  I did not seed the tomatoes and they were just fine. This is ridiculously good.  Way beyond the effort it takes to make it.  Tastes nice warm or cool.
