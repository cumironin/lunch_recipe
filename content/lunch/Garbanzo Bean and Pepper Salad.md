description: "I made up this recipe for a cool summer dish to take to a picnic. I just threw together things I had on hand and it became a hit! You may substitute your favorite type of bean for the garbanzos. Any firm bean will do. You may omit the jalapeno altogether. This salad will work as a main course and is very satisfying and colorful. The different tastes and textures are very pleasing. Serve cold."
