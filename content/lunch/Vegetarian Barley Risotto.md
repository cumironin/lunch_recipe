Based on rice risotto, this dish is a flavorful, healthy, and filling entree. It is also more nutritious than Arborio risotto because it's a good source of fiber and whole grain and is full of vegetables. I invented it to satisfy my meat-loving family on my Meatless Monday and it was a great success!
