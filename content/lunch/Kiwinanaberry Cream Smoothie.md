description: "I came up with this because I had a ton of kiwi that was going to go bad soon and I couldn't find any decent recipes for kiwi so I settled on making my own smoothie. Well, it turned out I wasn't settling because it turned out fantastic, and I normally don't care for smoothies much. I used a bunch of different fruit, but kiwi is the main fruit here and the smoothie has a nice slightly tart, tangy, and sweet taste. I use soy milk, but non-fat milk would taste the same. I also used tangelos because that's what I had, but oranges or tangerines would work just as well."
recipe_ingredient: ['5 kiwis', '1 banana', '2 tangelos', '1 cup mixed fresh berries', '1\u2009½ cups plain yogurt', '1\u2009¼ cups soy milk', '1 tablespoon white sugar', '1 sprig fresh mint leaves']
