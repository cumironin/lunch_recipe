Reduced-sodium chicken broth can be used. This recipe keeps well in the fridge and can be served warm or cold."

This is a recipe that is great as a side or even as a meal. It's so hearty! It's great served warm or cold. I sometimes substitute chickpeas for the lentils, but  be aware that they have a slightly stronger flavor. The white wine is used for flavor but can be left out if desired. Reduced-sodium chicken broth can be used. This recipe keeps well in the fridge and can be served warm or cold.
