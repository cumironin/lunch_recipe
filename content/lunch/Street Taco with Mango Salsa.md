description: "We are not vegetarian but like to eat healthy. I created this because we love to substitute grains and sometimes tofu for meat. When I make one that my husband raves about, I like to share it. Don't be afraid to try a variety of grains as meat substitutes. Doesn't have to always be tofu. Feel free to use ground turkey, pork, or chicken. Play with the spices. I sure do! Enjoy."
