description: "My husband loves this zesty Southwestern-style fish. You can make it with any of firm whitefish--like cod or halibut--if tilapia isn't available. You can even use boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I usually make a package of red or black beans with rice to serve with it while the fish cooks. If you have any leftovers, they make great fish tacos."
