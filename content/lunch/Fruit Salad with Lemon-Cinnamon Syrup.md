description: "This is a sweet fruit salad intended to be served as a low-fat dessert. The syrup is essential; without it, you just have an ordinary fruit salad, for which you probably don't need a recipe! You can vary the fruits to use what you have on hand. This is especially good with strawberries and melon. Bananas might be too overpowering, though."
