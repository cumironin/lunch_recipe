description: "After lots of experimenting to develop a low-fat ice cream or gelato, I came up with this recipe. Despite the lengthy instructions, it's very simple to make. I couldn't believe how wonderfully rich and creamy it turned out to be. The secret is in the cocoa powder, which makes the gelato dense and rich without adding fat. Because the gelato contains no fat, leftovers will freeze hard. To soften, defrost leftovers in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds."
