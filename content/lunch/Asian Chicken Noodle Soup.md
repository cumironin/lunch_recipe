description: "This is an authentic, 'home-style' dish served in Taiwanese homes. You can vary the easy-to-buy ingredients however you want to yield as many servings as you want. Try adding a couple of tablespoons of whole kernel corn.  Super easy to make, kids can do it too! Tender noodles coupled with subtle chicken broth, all with succulent pieces of chicken, exotic shitake mushrooms and a slow-simmered egg ... my favorite rainy-day meal!"
