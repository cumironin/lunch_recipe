These are a fun and healthy treats for breakfast, dessert, or a party appetizer. Easily adaptable to suit any taste and any season. Great for vegetarians. The prep and cooking times are approximate and account for blanching fruits and slicing. Next time I will try different fruits and preserve flavors, and maybe candied bananas instead of rice.
