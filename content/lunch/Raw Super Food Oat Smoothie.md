This method is so easy and convenient since its just throwing everything in the blender and then storing it in the fridge. I like to add superfoods to these oats to get the most nutrients first thing in the morning. I like to add chlorella powder, maca powder, and spirulina powder. You can also top your oats with more superfoods like goji berries, or these."
