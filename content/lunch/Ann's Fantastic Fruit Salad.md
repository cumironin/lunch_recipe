If you don't like a particular fruit, just substitute it with one that you like! Sometimes my mother-in-law uses peeled and chopped pear in this recipe, you can use pomegranate seeds, mandarin oranges...just whatever seasonal fruit is available to you, it's a very forgiving recipe and completely full of vitamins."
