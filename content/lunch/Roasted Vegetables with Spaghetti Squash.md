This is a great fall dish. Roasted veggies sit on a bed of spaghetti squash and are topped with a little melted cheese. Note: vegetables can easily be substituted. I have made this many times with whatever is on hand. However, when I can, I try to use mostly root vegetables in yellow and orange colors.
