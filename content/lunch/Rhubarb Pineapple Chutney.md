description: "This is a great way to use rhubarb and goes really well with pork. Also yummy on crostini with goat cheese; simply brush sliced baguette with olive oil and bake at 400 degrees F until golden brown, spread with goat cheese, and top with the chutney. Delicious! Another great use for the rhubarb chutney is as a topping for pork chops. Season chops (or pork tenderloin) with a mixture of even parts cumin, coriander, garlic powder, and salt, plus a sprinkle of cayenne; grill, then serve with the chutney. It gets raves every time!"
