description: "Hala kahiki is the Hawaiian word for pineapple. This is a seven-ingredient smoothie that is rich in vitamin C and other nutrients. Spinach gives it a beautiful green color yet it tastes tropically sweet. Great for breakfast or a mid-afternoon pick-me-up. Can adjust ice or water to achieve desired thickness of smoothie. I prefer mine not very thick."
