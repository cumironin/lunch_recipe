Slightly bitter and extremely refreshing, this is one instance of what I have dubbed blender-miracles. Throw everything in and blend away! Make sure to use a well-ripened banana to add extra sweetness. If the end result is still slightly too bitter, blend in sugar to taste. This pairs nicely with a balsamic salad.
