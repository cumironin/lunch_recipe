This casserole is the tastiest chicken dish that I have ever tasted. The sweet potato adds an interesting addition to the chicken, alternatively butternut squash can be used in its place. Everyone I have ever cooked this casserole for has loved it! Serve with rice or mashed potato with fresh, crisp green vegetables.
