I got this recipe from a friend about thirty years ago.  It has become a family favorite.  It makes a lot, so it's great to serve to a crowd.  Also, it can be made ahead and re-heated very easy.  The original recipe calls for regular pork Italian sausage, but to cut down on fat, I use the turkey kind.
