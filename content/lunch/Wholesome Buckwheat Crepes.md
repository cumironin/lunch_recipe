description: "These gluten-free, lactose-free crepes are not only made 100% with buckwheat, but they use wholesome raw buckwheat groats instead of buckwheat flour, which often has a very strong flavor when not fresh. Soaking the groats before using them develops a lovely texture and a delicious, soft nutty taste. After blending you end up with a smooth batter. These crepes do not crisp up and become golden but they are very pliable and go great with maple syrup, berries, jam, and mashed bananas as filling."
