This is a recipe from my great-grandma with simple ingredients. This bread is moist, healthy, and delicious. You can easily cut back on the sugar and switch out ingredients depending on taste or dietary restrictions. I love to use dried cranberries instead of raisins, reducing the sugar by several tablespoons when I do.
