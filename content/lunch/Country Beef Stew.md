The most comforting of comfort foods, beef sirloin cubes are baked to perfection in a Dutch oven with vegetables and diced tomatoes. I thought this recipe was tasty, relatively healthy, and a definite comfort food during a blizzard. Keep an eye on your fluid levels; I thought they were too low. My next attempt will likely have more water or a broth if I can find one without sodium.
