description: "This is a simple yakitori recipe.  Use it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs and leeks on skewers on the grill.  I had never heard of this food until I first went to Japan.  It's the equivalent to hot dog carts here in the states.  You can get it everywhere from street vendors.  Yakitori has become more popular here in the states over the last five years.  I've even seen it in the frozen food section.  It's easy to make if you have a grill though."
