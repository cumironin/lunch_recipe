This shake is delicious, filling and nutritious...a perfect drink after a hard workout at the gym. 

I've been drinking it for years. Everyone who's tried it falls in love with it. 

I drink it every morning after I finish my workout around 8am and I stay full until 11:30am.  
I use a Nutri-Bullet® as it's the perfect size and it works really well, but any blender will do.
