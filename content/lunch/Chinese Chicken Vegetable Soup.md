Knowing all the ingredients that were there, I went to work to make my own recipe for this very tasty soup. Plus I'm a big fan of 'make it tasty, fast and easy' which this is, when I run the veggies through my food processor. Also when I not feel well, this is one soup that has all what help me feel better.  I also serve this with steamed rice as a side dish for those who want it as well."
