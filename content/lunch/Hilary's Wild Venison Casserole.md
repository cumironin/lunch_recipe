I am lucky to be able to get venison at my local Farmers' Market.  I invented this dish - as far as I am aware, this is an original created by me.  The black beluga lentils go really well with the venison as they are both quite earthy flavored.  If black beluga lentils are not available, Puy lentils can be used.
