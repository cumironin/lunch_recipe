description: "While on our honeymoon in eastern West Virginia, Joe and I frequented the 'Purple Fiddle', an eclectic coffee shop and cafe with yummy wraps, soups, sandwiches, and the best hummus I've ever tasted! Once we visited for the second time, I just had to ask one of the employees what the secret was to this 'it's got a kick to it' hummus: red cayenne pepper, not just black pepper, alongside cumin, sea salt, and fresh cilantro. Yum! I could eat this hummus with anything from carrots to grilled pita wedges! Garnish hummus with extra cilantro (and lime slices if you have them)!"
