description: "I made some alterations for this wonderful and rich Southern favorite! This cake has all the flavor and richness of a traditional red velvet cake, but you won't feel guilty while enjoying it! With the use of whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, you are getting fiber and dessert in one! The frosting that goes with this cake is equally delicious and almost guilt free! This cake is delicious!"

I made some alterations for this wonderful and rich Southern favorite! This cake has all the flavor and richness of a traditional red velvet cake, but you won't feel guilty while enjoying it! With the use of whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, you are getting fiber and dessert in one! The frosting that goes with this cake is equally delicious and almost guilt free! This cake is delicious!
