This restricted version of the paleo diet, in addition to prohibiting grains, legumes, and dairy, also excludes eggs, nuts, seeds (including seed-based spices) and nightshades (potatoes, peppers, eggplant, and tomatoes) in an effort to minimize – and in some cases to cure – leaky gut and many autoimmune diseases. But you know how it is, we Italians love our tomato sauce."

Nowadays many people are following the autoimmune paleo protocol (AIP). This restricted version of the paleo diet, in addition to prohibiting grains, legumes, and dairy, also excludes eggs, nuts, seeds (including seed-based spices) and nightshades (potatoes, peppers, eggplant, and tomatoes) in an effort to minimize – and in some cases to cure – leaky gut and many autoimmune diseases.

 But you know how it is, we Italians love our tomato sauce.
