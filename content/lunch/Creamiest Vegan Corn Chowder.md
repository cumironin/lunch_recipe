description: "The base of this soup used to be a roux-thickened chicken broth with milk and cheese added. However, since becoming vegan, I had to adapt, and I'm proud to say that this version is thicker and creamier than the original, and it was all achieved without a drop of flour or milk. It's not only the best vegan corn chowder recipe I've had, but it's just plain the best corn chowder ever. Even my non-vegan family loves it, and they request it regularly. This recipe makes a lot, but it keeps and freezes very well."
