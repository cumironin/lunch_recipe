This is the recipe that my husband's grandmother made for her family, my mother-in-law made for hers, and I have inherited the fun of making this bread for mine.  We particularly like this fresh out of the oven, and then eat it daily for breakfast.  My father-in-law at 86 years old bragged about never having eaten a slice of 'store bought bread.'
