I don't know what it is about this combination of flavors, but I could eat these every day. Even though it contains the right ingredients in the right proportions for a teriyaki sauce, which is what I was aiming for originally, to describe the flavor as such would be inaccurate. I'm usually perfectly happy with this and a bowl of rice as a meal in itself, but when I'm forced to share, it pairs well with roasted chicken or just about any kind of pork.
