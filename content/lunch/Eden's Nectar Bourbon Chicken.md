An aromatic and savory mango and peach grilled chicken dish bolstered with bourbon. This recipe is not a quick fix for dinner. I usually prepare my marinade around noon so that dinner is ready right around 6 pm. There are a lot of variables with grilling, ensure you have the proper amount of coals and it is the proper temp or you will mess this dish up.
