I've   also made it with smoked ham hocks I've gotten from the butcher.  Of  course the home smoked ham makes the soup superlative, the butcher bone made it wonderful.  Either way, I think you'll enjoy it.  It can be made spicy if that's the way you prefer it.  It can also be topped with sour cream."

This is a simple recipe, yet it is the best black bean soup I've tried.  I have   been lucky to get home smoked ham, and used the bone from it.  I've   also made it with smoked ham hocks I've gotten from the butcher.  Of  course the home smoked ham makes the soup superlative, the butcher bone made it wonderful.  Either way, I think you'll enjoy it.  It can be made spicy if that's the way you prefer it.  It can also be topped with sour cream.
