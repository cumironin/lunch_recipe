description: "Chicken Makhani is a dish I always loved before becoming vegan. It is my absolute favorite Indian dish, so I knew I had to try to make it so I could curb my cravings. The sauce tastes amazing with naan and white rice. The seitan is an excellent substitute for meat in many dishes. You can buy store-bought seitan, which can be expensive, or you can make your own."

Chicken Makhani is a dish I always loved before becoming vegan. It is my absolute favorite Indian dish, so I knew I had to try to make it so I could curb my cravings. The sauce tastes amazing with naan and white rice. The seitan is an excellent substitute for meat in many dishes. You can buy store-bought seitan, which can be expensive, or you can make your own.
