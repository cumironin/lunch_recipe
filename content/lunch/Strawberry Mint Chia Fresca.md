description: "Refreshing, healthy, and energizing drink containing coconut water for electrolytes and mint for a cool taste. Chia seeds are high in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants. Inspired by Mexican Chia Fresca and my love for mojitos! The juice can be drunk without waiting the 30 minutes, but the seeds might stick to the glass more. A juicer can be used to juice the strawberries and mint. Doing so will give more mint flavor and may require using less mint to begin with."
