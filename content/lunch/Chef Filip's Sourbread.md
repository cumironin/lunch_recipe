To begin the starter, mix together 1 1/4 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups water, 1/2 teaspoon malt and 1/2 teaspoon of honey. Mix well, cover and leave at room temperature for 24 hours. Repeat the process for days 2 and three.{{< span >}}

Grease any pans you wish to use. Give the loaves their final shape - loaves, baguettes or round and place onto the prepared pans. Let the loaves rise until double in size.
