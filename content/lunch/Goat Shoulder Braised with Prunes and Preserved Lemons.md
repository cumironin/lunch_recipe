Goat is a delicious, mild-flavored meat that is overlooked in the U.S.  This recipe results in a tender, savory dish that, while unusual, is still basically good old comfort food.  This would be great to serve with Israeli-style couscous; alternatively, you could add some potato chunks to the pan halfway through the cooking.
