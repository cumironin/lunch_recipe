My grandmother always made this to eat as a side salad with sandwiches or cold meat. I have seen similar recipes called Amish Pickled Coleslaw. It is a little extra work with the soaking but it is a nice change from other pickle or relish recipes. Add a jalapeno pepper to each jar if you like heat.
