**Step: 1**

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the angel hair pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.{{< span >}}

Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the shrimp and onion; cook and stir until the shrimp are beginning to turn pink, about 2 minutes. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic. Continue cooking until the shrimp are no longer opaque in the center and the onion has turned translucent, about 4 minutes.
