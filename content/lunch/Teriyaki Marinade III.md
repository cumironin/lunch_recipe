description: "Easy and wonderful teriyaki marinade for barbeque or roasting. For a zestier marinade, use lime or lemon juice; for a milder version, use water. If you would like to use the marinade as a sauce, you can boil it after removing the meat and add a little slurry of cornstarch and warm water to thicken it. When I make the sauce, I usually add some sesame seeds for looks. You can add fresh or ground ginger if you like, too."
