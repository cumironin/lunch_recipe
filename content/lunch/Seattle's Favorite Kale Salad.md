This is my interpretation of a wonderful, good-for-you kale salad originally prepared by Seattle's top natural foods grocery chain. The flavorful wild rice, kale, and veggie combination with a lemony dressing can be made year-round and earns raves whenever it's served. It also keeps wonderfully, so make it ahead with no hesitation.
