description: "This is a Southern California version of sweet and sour chicken, marinated and grilled with a little extra spice. Great for all barbeque lovers. I usually serve cut into lengths with fresh cilantro, homemade salsa, guacamole, black beans, and flour tortillas warmed on the grill. A little good Southern California karma never hurts anyone. This recipe is light enough to offset the first 2 margaritas. GO CHARGERS!!!"
