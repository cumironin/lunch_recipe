You can either bake this bread or fry it. For variety, I like to make four of each.

There are two ways to cook pita bread. The flavor is a bit different with both.   To Bake Pita:  Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) and put a pita on a wire cake rack. Toss in the rack and cook for 3 minutes or until the bread stops puffing up. When you take it out, smash down the pita (Careful, its hot!) and quickly put it in a plastic freezer bag.
