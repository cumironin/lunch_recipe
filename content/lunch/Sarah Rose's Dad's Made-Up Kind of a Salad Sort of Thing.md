Transfer to a salad bowl while still hot, and season to taste with salt, black pepper, half the minced garlic, half the basil, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Refrigerate to chill, about 30 minutes.{{< span >}}

**Step: 2**

In another bowl, mix the remaining minced garlic, basil, 2 more tablespoons of olive oil, grape tomatoes, red onion, black olives, and sliced mushrooms. Lightly toss the chilled spaghetti mixture into the grape tomato mixture, and season with salt and black pepper if needed. For best flavor, allow the pasta mixture to chill overnight to blend the flavors.{{< span >}}
