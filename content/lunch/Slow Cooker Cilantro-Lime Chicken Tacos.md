This has quickly become one of our favorite dinners in our house. My husband and I add jalapenos and hot sauce. My son loves these topped with cheese and sour cream as well. It's from a bunch of different recipes; I just took out what I loved most about each one and threw it together. It's quick and easy, and with the leftover chicken (when there is any) I make a pot pie or chicken and dumplings.
