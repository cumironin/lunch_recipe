Cut each potato into wedges by quartering the potatoes, then cutting each quarter in half. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet, and cook and stir the onion and mushrooms until the mushrooms start to release their liquid and the onion becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onion and mushrooms into a bowl, and set aside.{{< span >}}
