I came up with this recipe after a search for a whole wheat pita bread left me frustrated. I used soy flour to totally eliminate white flour. What resulted was a hearty pita with a nice nutty flavor. It tastes great with sandwich fillings, peanut butter, or dipped in hummus. This is my first recipe, so I hope you enjoy it.
