description: "Halushky is a Ukrainian name for dumplings made of batter or thick dough mixture. Various ingredients are added for tenderness, texture, flavor, and food value. They are served with a stew, or roast and gravy, or as a side dish. Good halushky should be light. Their lightness depends on the proportions used and on the method of cooking them. This standard recipe may be varied as desired. Dry curd cheese is preferred for a filling because a wet, creamy one will melt giving flat and empty varenyky or halushky."
