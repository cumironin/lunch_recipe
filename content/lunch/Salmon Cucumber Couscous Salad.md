description: "I made this when I needed to clean out my pantry and use up our crop of cucumbers. This salad is light, fresh, and fast. You can add in whatever fresh vegetables you have on hand, and experiment with herbs and dressings. I didn't have any lemons on hand but I had a lemon poppy seed dressing which was too thick for this salad, so I thinned it into a vinaigrette with olive oil and vinegar. I served this with a hard-boiled egg on the side for an extra protein kick."
