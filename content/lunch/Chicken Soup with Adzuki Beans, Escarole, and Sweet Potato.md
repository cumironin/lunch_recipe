description: "This absolutely delicious soup was created to help use up the Adzuki beans, wild rice, and sweet potatoes in my pantry. I decided to use the sweet potato instead of regular potatoes, and was delightfully surprised by the wonderful flavor blend it created with the sweetness of the onions, garlic, and Adzuki beans. I also wanted to try escarole in a soup, and the result was fantastic. Adzuki beans are found in any health food or specialty store, and in many national grocery chains. They have a great nutty, slightly sweet taste, and are especially tasty added to chicken soups of any kind."
