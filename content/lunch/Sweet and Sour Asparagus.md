description: "This is great at a picnic when you have tired of all the same old salads.  Very versatile, you can serve it cold or room temperature. You can certainly chop up the asparagus, but I found that it always overcooks.  I like the presentation of the long spears on a nice white platter. This goes great with a platter of sliced baked ham and some potato salad or with hamburgers and hot dogs.  Enjoy!"
