Butternut squash, sweet potato, carrot, and garlic roasted in large pieces and then added to onion, celery, apple, and vegetable broth. Immersion blender does the trick for thickening without adding fat. Use curry powder in place of cayenne if you prefer more savory flavors than spicy. Apple juice can also be used in place of cider, and chicken broth in place of vegetable.
