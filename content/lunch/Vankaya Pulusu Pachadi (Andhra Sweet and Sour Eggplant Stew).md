This is a classic Andhra dish consisting of roasted eggplant (brinjal) in a sweet and sour stew. The sweetness is from jaggery and the sourness is from tamarind. This pulusu is an excellent accompaniment to patholi, or mudda pappu (plain hard-cooked dal). I also like it just by itself with plain rice and ghee.
