Roasted vegetables are one of my absolute favorite side dishes, especially in the winter. They take a while to cook, but overall are an extremely easy dish to prepare. I've found that the key is to place them low in the oven so that you get a good caramelized side. Don't move or flip them, but keep an eye on them so that you don't go past 'caramelized' to 'burned.'
