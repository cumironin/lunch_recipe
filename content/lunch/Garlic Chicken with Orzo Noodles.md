description: "This is a simple recipe with a spicy kick for garlic lovers. It is my combination of a much loved linguine and clam sauce dish and a recent introduction to orzo pasta. I have several variations for this recipe.  Add more red pepper for extra spice.  Substitute the chicken for clams or shrimp.  Substitute the spinach leaves for diced tomatoes.  I've also added spices such as basil, rosemary and oregano bringing a distinct Italian flavor to the dish."
