description: "This is a new spin on a traditional Jewish food. They're very sweet and fun to make, making it a great recipe for kids who want to help out in the kitchen. They also make great finger food for parties. Be sure to remove any jewelry before getting started though - you'll be putting your hands into a very sticky mess, and it can get everywhere! Serve hot with apricot preserves, applesauce, maple syrup, or parmesan cheese. If you have a food processor, that will probably work as well, though I prefer the extra-fine result that comes from using a cheese grater. They can also be frozen and reheated."
