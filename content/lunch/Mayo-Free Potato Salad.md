description: "I created this recipe as I do not use mayo in anything!  It has great flavor. The coloring on this is not 'white' because of the no mayo.  The Dijon and paprika give it a rustic look. Experiment with flavored oil, olives, and vinegars.  I used Persian lime olive oil. This recipe can be modified easily, including adding crispy bacon to it. Enjoy!"
