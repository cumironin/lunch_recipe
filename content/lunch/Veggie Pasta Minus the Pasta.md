This dish leaves even the biggest pasta lover satisfied. Fresh vegetables make this dish wonderful and it's easy to add meat to if you wish. The first time I made it, my husband fell in love and everyone wanted the recipe. This dish is great topped with a small amount of shredded cheese. I recommend Gouda.
