description: "Great snack or side dish to a healthy (baked not fried) meal.  First time I made these, it was sort of an experiment; but apparently it was a successful one, because these fries disappeared in no time! Perfect on their own or with your favorite potato dip. Can be made on the grill as well and make a great side for a summer barbecue!"
