This recipe is best used immediately, as fresh fruit doesn't keep well in the refrigerator. If you prefer baked cinnamon chips, arrange the tortilla triangles in a single layer on a lightly greased baking sheet. Spray with cooking spray, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and bake 5 to 10 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Watch them closely so they don't burn!"
