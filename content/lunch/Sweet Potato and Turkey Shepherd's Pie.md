Savory turkey is mixed with a touch of stuffing and a layer of vegetables, all topped with a fluffy and sweet potato mixture. Don't have time to make from scratch? Then simply substitute your turkey dinner leftovers! Chopped, cooked turkey and your homemade gravy can be substituted for the ground turkey mixture. Leftover vegetables greatly reduce prep time."
