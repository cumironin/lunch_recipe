description: "This whole wheat bread has a really good taste depending on your flour. I think King Arthur® is the best! This bread has cocoa and coffee in it. It can be made by hand, or use your bread machine's dough setting to knead and rise, then bake it in the oven. If you are not feeling bold you can leave out the cocoa and coffee and add some nuts. Have fun! Form into a freehand loaf or place into a greased loaf pan."

This whole wheat bread has a really good taste depending on your flour. I think King Arthur® is the best! This bread has cocoa and coffee in it. It can be made by hand, or use your bread machine's dough setting to knead and rise, then bake it in the oven. If you are not feeling bold you can leave out the cocoa and coffee and add some nuts. Have fun! Form into a freehand loaf or place into a greased loaf pan.
