description: "This is a good recipe for people who are trying to improve their diet! Delicious and super! I got this recipe from an empanada recipe. This was supposed to be a filling for the empanada, but when I was making it one day I messed up the dough and ended up not knowing what to do with the filling, so I just took a piece of bread and slapped some of the filling on bread; and I was like 'This isn't so bad.' Ever since then, it's one of my favorite recipes. Hope you guys like it! Garnish with kale leaves if desired."
