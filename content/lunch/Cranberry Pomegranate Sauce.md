description: "This is a delicious fruit-filled version of cranberry sauce.  The pomegranate is cooked separately to facilitate seed removal, then both parts are combined to finish cooking. It's wonderful as an accompaniment for poultry, and can be made into a lovely trifle-type dessert with vanilla pudding and pound cake."

This is a delicious fruit-filled version of cranberry sauce.  The pomegranate is cooked separately to facilitate seed removal, then both parts are combined to finish cooking.
