description: "This very hearty soup is easy and can be adjusted depending on what meat bones you may have on hand. This is a great way to use up any left over roast from a previous meal. We used a bone from a leg of lamb and a beef rib roast originally cooked on the charcoal grill for a family holiday celebration, and the flavor was extraordinarily rich. Serve with crusty bread."

This very hearty soup is easy and can be adjusted depending on what meat bones you may have on hand. This is a great way to use up any left over roast from a previous meal. We used a bone from a leg of lamb and a beef rib roast originally cooked on the charcoal grill for a family holiday celebration, and the flavor was extraordinarily rich. Serve with crusty bread.
