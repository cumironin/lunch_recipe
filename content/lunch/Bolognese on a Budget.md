description: "This delicious bolognese is extremely quick and easy to make. Serve over pasta, rice, couscous, or any other carbohydrate food you fancy. This sauce gets better the longer it simmers. If you do allow it to simmer for a longer time, check regularly and add water as needed. This sauce also lends itself beautifully to adding vegetables such as zucchini, eggplant, carrots, and mushrooms."
