Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for 10 minutes. Pack the jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top.

**Step: 3**

Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars.

Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.{{< span >}}

**Step: 4**

Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool dark area.{{< span >}}
