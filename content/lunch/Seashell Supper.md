description: "My mom made this as a throw together meal when I was a kid  She was surprised when, as an adult, I served it 'outside the family'.  It's a wonderful kid-pleaser, and very easy to make.  A meal in itself!  Although, cornbread on the side is a great touch. Even the leftovers are delicious, warmed or cold.  I often find myself with a fork digging into the leftover bowl right out of the fridge:)"
