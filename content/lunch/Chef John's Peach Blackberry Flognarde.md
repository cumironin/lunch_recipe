I enjoy saying flognarde so much that I think even if this recipe hadn't come out as well as it did I would still make it regularly, just to say 'flognarde'."

I was looking around for a name for this unusual clafoutis-like combination of peaches, blackberries, thyme, and black pepper. I saw an article that said in France a clafoutis that uses fruit other than cherries is called a flognarde. I enjoy saying flognarde so much that I think even if this recipe hadn't come out as well as it did I would still make it regularly, just to say 'flognarde'.
