description: "This is an extremely healthy drink I have almost every morning and great on detoxes as you get all your needed nutrients. You just have to play around to find the perfect drink. I find if you add beetroot, it makes it a fantastic color and gives extra flavor. To get the full benefit of the flavor, swish the juice around in your mouth; this is where lots of nutrients are digested. Enjoy!"
