description: "My dad used to make huge Thanksgiving dinners, and the morning after, we would be treated to delicious turkey congee. Congee is a Chinese rice porridge traditionally eaten for breakfast or brunch, but I personally eat it any time. It is also very good for digestion and has excellent health benefits. Although I've been having congee since I was a baby, it remains for me the ultimate comfort food."
