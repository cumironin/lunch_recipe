description: "This oatmeal is warm, sweet, and lusciously filling, and it leaves me satisfied for hours! It is also incredibly versatile. Switch out any of the ingredients for whatever you fancy. I find it works well with some vanilla extract instead of almond and topped with crunchy peanut butter and a drizzle of honey! If you like your oatmeal just a bit thicker, use a little less milk or cook for a little longer."
