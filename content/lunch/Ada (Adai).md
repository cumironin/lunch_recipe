description: "Ada is a type of dosa (crepe) usually served at breakfast. It is made with a mixture of lentils and rice, and is quite filling. It is typically eaten with podi (south Indian spicy chutney powder) and mango pickle (avakkai). Since the batter is made with raw lentils, it gets fermented easily. It will keep in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 days maximum."
